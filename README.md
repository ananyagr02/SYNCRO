Introduction:
Our proposal aims to develop a web platform tailored for students to set and track their goals in collaboration with their peers. The platform will foster a healthy and friendly competitive environment, motivating students to achieve their goals while engaging with their friends and peers.

Problem Statement:
Many students struggle with setting and achieving their goals, often lacking accountability and motivation. Additionally, there's a lack of platforms specifically designed to support goal setting and tracking among students in a collaborative manner. There are many social media platforms but non of them focuses on both betterment of the user and trying to make the better by pushing them towards their goals and achieving it.

Solution Overview:
Our solution is to create a web platform that enables students to:

1. Set personal goals for various aspects of their lives, such as academic, fitness, personal development, etc.
2. Connect and collaborate with their friends and peers to set group goals and track progress collectively.
3. Engage in friendly competition through leaderboards and gamification elements.
4. Receive support and encouragement from peers to stay motivated and accountable.

Key Features:

1. Goal Setting: Users can create and customize their personal goals, specifying details such as target achievement date, milestones, and category.
2. Group Goals: Users can form groups with their friends and peers to set collective goals, fostering teamwork and collaboration.
3. Progress Tracking: Users can regularly update their progress towards their goals, either individually or as a group, using various metrics and visualization tools.
4. Leaderboards: A leaderboard feature will display the progress and achievements of users and groups, encouraging friendly competition and recognition.
5. Social Interaction: Users can interact with each other through comments, likes, and messages, providing support, motivation, and accountability.
6. Gamification Elements: Integrate gamification elements such as badges, achievements, and rewards to incentivize goal achievement and engagement.

Tech Stack:

- Backend: Python (Django), Node.js (Express.js)
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js)
  (currently we have working frontend)
- Deployment: AWS, Heroku

Target Audience:
Our primary target audience is students in educational institutions, including schools, colleges, and universities. However, the platform can also be beneficial for any individuals looking to set and achieve goals in a collaborative environment.

Benefits:

- Empowers students to take control of their goals and aspirations.
- Fosters a sense of community and support among peers.
- Promotes accountability and motivation through friendly competition.
- Provides a platform for personal growth and development.

Conclusion:
Our goal is to create a user-friendly and engaging platform that addresses the needs of students in setting and achieving their goals. By participating in this hackathon, we aim to develop a prototype of the platform and demonstrate its potential to positively impact the lives of students.

Thank you for considering our proposal. We look forward to the opportunity to bring this idea to life and make a meaningful contribution to the hackathon.

FEATURES
An individual can join different communities based on the goals they want to achieve. the community and their members can interact with each other and keep themselves accountable by keeping check on each other ant try to motivate each other. there would be badges based on the performance of an individual, and can post about the same. there would be a leaderboard of each community keeping track which members has completed how many tasks, this would help to create healthy competition.
further to minimize distraction we will integrate screen time to keep track of the individual schedule. Furthermore adding a chat section in the community for a short time like for an hour at the end of the day, would minimize the screen time and prevent our product from becoming a distraction.
further adding a calender in which the days will ger color-coded on the basis of how much work is done. similar like the github calendar.
Further adding matching criteria, for example an individual is setting goals for a particular topic thus our system would suggest other users with same goals so that if both of them want to sync their goals and keep each other accountable they can. Similarly suggestions of same goal-oriented communities to the individual will also help them.
leaderboard rank would be determined among those members whose goals match significantly to avoid any miss calculations.
